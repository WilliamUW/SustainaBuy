## üí° Inspiration

- We all want to be sustainable, but it can be challenging.
- Two major barriers are the time-consuming research required to find
sustainable products and the lack of incentives for people to shop
sustainably.
- Our team aimed to overcome these obstacles at Hack the MIST for not just us, but the **2.14 billion e-commerce shoppers** around the world.

## ü§ñ What It Does

- Say hello to the future of sustainable shopping with SustainaBuy -
the tool that helps you find the perfect product for both you and the
planet, and rewards you for it! With one click, the extension pop-up
automatically fetches and displays product information, eliminating the
need for additional research.
- SustainaBuy also incentivizes eco-friendly purchases with credits from sponsors who want to offset their carbon footprint.

## üë®‚Äçüíª How We Built It

- We used JavaScript to implement the extension's logic and search
product webpages for information such as ingredients, manufacturer,
packaging, and other relevant details.
- HTML and CSS were used to design the extension's pop-up interface
where users can see the product's extracted information and
sustainability evaluation score.
- Finally, we employed OpenAI to evaluate the product based on a
specified set of parameters to generate an overall sustainability score.

## ü§Ø Challenges We Faced

- We faced challenges in scraping web data due to inconsistencies in the different layouts and field IDs.
- We also encountered issues with the OpenAI API keys, which reset without notice, leading to needless debugging.

## üòé Accomplishments We're Proud Of

- Through our work on SustainaBuy, we were able to build an extension
that has the potential to make a significant impact on sustainability.
- We're proud of the fact that we were able to create a tool that not
only makes it easier for consumers to make environmentally conscious
purchasing decisions, but also incentivizes them to do so.
- Additionally, we were able to successfully integrate the OpenAI API, which allowed us to evaluate the sustainability of products based on a
specified set of parameters.
What We Learned

## üòÉ What We Learned

- One of the biggest challenges we faced while working on SustainaBuy
was dealing with the inconsistencies in web data scraping due to
different layouts and field IDs.
- However, through trial and error, we were able to develop a system
that could reliably extract the relevant information from product web
pages.
- We also learned a lot about the OpenAI API and how it can be used to evaluate the sustainability of products.
- Using PostMan API Platform to test our API requests.
- Overall, we learned that building a sustainable shopping tool is a complex task that requires a lot of different skills and expertise.
- However, we also learned that with hard work and collaboration,
it's possible to create something that can make a real difference in the world.
- We're excited to continue working on SustainaBuy and to see how it can evolve and grow in the future.

## üòâ What's Next for SustainaBuy

- We hope to improve SustainaBuy's capabilities by incorporating user
feedback and expanding the set of parameters used to evaluate
sustainability.
- Our ultimate goal is to create a more sustainable future by encouraging eco-friendly consumer behavior.
